## A Quickstart for Heroku JAVA + Apache CXF with Spring

This source is a clone from https://github.com/erikkramer/heroku-spring-cxf-quickstart.

## Details

This project is mavenized, so as long as you have Maven, Java, Git, and the Heroku Toolbelt installed, you can:

  mvn clean package

and then
 
  foreman start web

to run the app locally using Foreman (part of the Heroku Toolbelt). Foreman will examine the profile to determine what to run.
